    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Trillium Newfoundlands is a family collaboration between mother, daughters, and our husbands. Our goal is to maintain our dogs as family pets, as well as breeding, conformation, and working dogs. Spreading our dogs between three households enables us to accomplish this. Originally, B.I.G. was my kennel name. Now that my children have joined in, we all felt Trillium is a more appropriate name.

    <p>In 1999 we purchased our first Newfoundland, Hickory Ridge's Onyx DD. She was a patient, kind teacher who taught us much about the breed. We tried our hand at conformation, draft work, and obedience. She successfully earned her Draft title. In 2002 we decided to breed our first litter. In her lifetime, she produced eight puppies. Two of these puppies were placed in show homes: our own Ch. B.I.G.'s Taking It all In Stride CD RN WD DD, and VN Ch. Brio's Life of Riley CD RN WRD DD. One puppy became very well known for his work in local hospitals for his therapy work. All are greatly loved by their families.

    <p>In 2011 we acquired GCh. Turftide's Meant To Be B.I.G, RN DD CD WD. She has been a wonderful addition to our family and always keeps us on our toes. She is a fabulous example of the Newfoundland breed both structurally and in temperament. Kismet has succeeded in both the conformation ring and in working events.  In 2015, Kismet won Select at the National Specialty and a Best In Show Owner Handled.  In Spring 2016, she was honored to be in the Top 10 Obedience Newfoundlands at the National Specialty.

    <p>In December 2014, Josh and Stephanie welcomed Holokai Umi A Thousand And One Nights at Trillium (Jasmine). She is a fun loving, smart girl with a wonderful natural working ability. She has done very well in her show career so far, winning Best Puppy in Show as a baby and then went on to win the American Bred class at the National Specialty in 2016.  Now finished with her Chamipionship, she has a bright future ahead of her in the show ring and beyond.

    <p>Phoebe (Mtn High and Trillium's It's All About Friends) joined our family in 2016.  Happiness and fun radiate from this girl.  She hasn't had much time in the show ring yet, but her first time out she won Best Beginner Puppy in Show.  We are excited to watch Phoebe mature into a beautiful show and working dog.

    <p>During these years, we learned much about health, grooming, handling, and training Newfs for various competitions. We are active in the Great Lakes Newfoundland Club and are members of the Newfoundland Club of America. Our dogs are health tested and breedings are thoroughly researched.
